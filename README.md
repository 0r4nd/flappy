# Flappy clone

This is a game I made to test my old-school display functions
- bilinear, rotozoom, text, hline, alphablend, etc

# Entities (Sprites, particles, text, etc)
The management of the entities is very bad, in the ideal it would be necessary to use a hash table, but it was not the objective.
